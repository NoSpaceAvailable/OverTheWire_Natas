# OverTheWire_Natas
OverTheWire is a great website to learn some Linux command lines for newbies. I love websec, so Natas will be my favourite.

This README.md file does not contain any instructions. I just want to say that at this time (10/2023) I'm totally new to web security (and Linux, too).
Everything I write here is not only to help newbies but also to serve as milestones on my journey to becoming a web security expert.
I love learning new things, and It's my pleasure if I receive any feedback about my writeups.
Don't hesitate to send your feedback at: lequoccuong250105@outlook.com

Thanks for your love, and wish you success on your chosen path!
